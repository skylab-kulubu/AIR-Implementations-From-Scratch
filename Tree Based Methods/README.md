# Tree Based Methods In Machine Learning

This folder includes some implementations of tree models in Machine Learning such as Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine. 
They are implemented using numpy and the code is at an educational level rather than being highly efficient as some of the Machine Learning libraries' implementations.

You can also check the [Jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/skylab-air/Implementations-From-Scratch/blob/main/Tree%20Based%20Methods/Tree%20Based%20Classification%20Applications.ipynb) if you want to see how well the algorithms are doing compared to one another in a data set.

Theoretical background of the algorithms are explained in the [tree-based-methods.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skylab-air/Writings/main/Tree%20Based%20Methods/tree-based-methods.pdf) file that's present in the Writings repo. You can read it if you
want to learn about them. Also, you can read in my [blog](https://tugrulhkarabulut.github.io/blog).
